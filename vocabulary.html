 <ul><li>When World War I was over, the french nobility found it <br>Impossible to return to their extravagant antebellum way of life . </li></ul>
    <p>Often the word <i>antebellum</i> Summons up images of ease, elegance, <br> and entertainment on a grand scale that disappeared  in the postwar <br> years.
    That way of life in the american south depended on a social <br>structure that collapsed after the war. The years after the Civil <br>War- and many other wars-were colored for some people by <br>nostalgia and bitterness(Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the wind <br> Shows this through the eyes of the southerb gentry), and for others <br> by relief and anticipation. </p>

   <p>The international relations of a nation with bellicose foreign policy <br> tend to be stormy and difficult, since such a nation looks for <br> opportunities to fight rather than to negotiate. Combative by nature, <br>it is happiest when quarrelling or, better yet, actively engaged in <br> battle.</p>
   <p> <Strong>Belligerence</Strong>  \<mark>be-li-je-rans </mark>\ aggressiveness, combativeness. </p>

Iraq's shocking belligerence toward kuwait and it's own  <br>kurdish people resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p>
   
   <p> <Strong>Rebellion</Strong>  \<mark>ri-'bel-yan</mark>\ Open defiance and opposition, sometimes <br> armed, to a person or thing in authority . </p>
   <ul><li>The substitute teacher attempted to end the student rebellion by <br> insisting on absolute quiet.</li></ul>
   <p>These days, some degree of rebellion against parents amd other <br>authority figures is viewed as a normal part of growing up , as long <br>as it is not destructive and does not go on too long. Rebellion, <br>
armed or otherwise, has often served to alert those in power to the <br> discontent of those they control. The american war of independency <br> was first viewed by the British as a minor rebellion that <br>would soon run its course.</p>
